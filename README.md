# MySwiftCV
This the code used to design and generate my cv in pdf using SwiftUI and PDFRenderer

The Device simulator i use is iPad Pro(9,7 inch)
if you want to make yours, you can just edit the sample data in the CV extension in CVModel.swift
Run it with the iPad and click on the save button in the top left Header
you'll get the path were the file is saved on your xcode consol, copy paste it in Folder app , go (top bar), go to folder
you can easily change the color on the main view



Here's an example of my own CV rendered with it
